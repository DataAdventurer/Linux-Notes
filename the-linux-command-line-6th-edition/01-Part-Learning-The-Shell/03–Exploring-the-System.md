ls command possible options.
$ ls -a
List all files also the hidden ones.
$ la -A
Does almost same job than -a but not included current directory and parent directory.
$ ls -S
Sort results by file size.
$ ls -l
Display results in long format.

You can see some file rights and it looks like this:
-rw-r--r-- 
Owner can read and write. Group can only read. Others can also only read.
You can also see who created the file and the name of the group who owns the file. Other things you can see about the file are the date and time it was modified, and the size of the file in bytes.

Commands that I learned:
$ ls /usr
$ ls ~ /usr
$ ls -l
$ ls -lt --reverse
$ less /etc/passwd
$ cd /proc           and many others
