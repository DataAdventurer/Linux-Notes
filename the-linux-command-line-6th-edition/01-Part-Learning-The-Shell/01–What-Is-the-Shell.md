What is shell?
Shell is the outer layer of the operating system. It interacts with the end user, like Bash on Linux, Command Prompt on Windows, or GNOME and so on. With the shell we can call applications.

A terminal emulator is, for example, GNOME Terminal. It is not physical; it mimics the real terminals that existed on computers in the 90s. A virtual console also emulates the original hardware, like allowing digital games in your console.

The command line is more useful for harder tasks compared to a graphical interface. Commands are often short and give greater control.

Commands that I learned:
$ date
$ uptime
$ df
$ free
$ exit
