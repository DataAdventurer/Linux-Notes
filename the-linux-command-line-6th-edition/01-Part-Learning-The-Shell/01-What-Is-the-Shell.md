Shell:
Shell is what we speak of as the command line. To the shell, we can make command lines with the keyboard and then it will pass them to the operating system to carry out.

Cursor Movement:
Easy way to navigate or to find your old command is to press the up or down arrow. Most Linux distributions remember the last 1000 commands by default.

Commands that I learned:
$ date
$ uptime
$ df
$ free
$ exit
