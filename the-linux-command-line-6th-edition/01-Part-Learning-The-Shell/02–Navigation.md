Linux hierarchical directory structure:
The Linux hierarchical directory structure looks and works like a tree pattern of directories (folders). Folders may contain files and other directories. The first directory is called the root directory. The root directory contains files and subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories, and so on. The difference between Linux and Windows is that Linux has a single root, while Windows has multiple roots.

The Root Directory is the starting point for the file system is the root folder. We call it the root, but its actual directory is "/".

Paths
A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system. An absolute path is a complete link to a resource also includes the protocol(https). A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file.

File extensions do not matter because Linux looks at what is inside the file. Extensions are useful for the user to know what the file contains, but for Linux itself they do not matter.

Commands that I learned:
$ pwd
$ cd
