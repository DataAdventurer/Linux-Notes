Linux hierarchical directory structure:
Linux hierarchical directory structure looks and works like a tree pattern of directories (folders). Folders may contain files and other directories. The first directory is called the root directory. The root directory contains files and subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories, and so on.

Commands that I learned:
$ pwd
$ cd
$ ls
$ cd ..
$ cd /bin
